                <a href="https://github.com/AdithyaChalla12/T20-World-Cup-Analysis" target="_blank"><h3>Men's T20 World Cup Data Analysis Project</h3></a>
                  <li>Performed data cleaning and transformation on the Men's T20 World Cup dataset using Excel's Power Query Editor, ensuring
                    data accuracy and quality.</li>
               <li>
                Created new measures and utilized pivot tables to analyze key metrics and trends in the T20 World Cup.
               </li> 
               <li>Designed visualizations to represent data insights, enhancing the clarity and impact of the final report</li>
               <li>Worked on visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, employing libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to
                uncover patterns and trends in the Men's T20 World Cup dataset.</li>

                <a href="https://github.com/AdithyaChalla12/Network-Intrusion-Detection-System" target="_blank"><h3>Hybrid Intrusion Detection System</h3></a>
                <li>Applied a correlation-based feature selection algorithm and various machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy in
                    identifying potential attack classes within the dataset.</li>
                <li>Concurrently trained and evaluated the performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network
                    (RNN) models.</li>
                <li>Identified the best-performing classifiers, which were then integrated into the Hybrid IDS to maximize detection accuracy across diverse attack scenarios.</li>

                <a href="https://github.com/AdithyaChalla12/Mini_Project_RubixcubeSolver" target="_blank"><h3>Rubix's Cube Solver</h3></a>
                <li>Developed a Rubik’s Cube solver using Python and OpenCV to detect and solve scrambled cube configurations.</li>
                <li>Worked on extracting cube colors using a camera feed and convert BGR to HSV for accurate color detection in various environments.</li>
                <li>Implemented Kociemba’s algorithm to compute the optimal solution and return a set of moves for solving the cube.</li>
                <li>Tried ensuring the system works efficiently in different lighting conditions and backgrounds for robust performance.</li>
